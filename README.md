# ate-1-step-estimator
R Shiny app for visualisation of the 1-step estimator for the Average Treatment Effect (ATE). Before using the app it is *strongly recommended* that you read the two papers

* Visually Communicating and Teaching Intuition for Influence Functions by Fisher and Kennedy (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03260)
* Demystifying statistical learning based on efficient influence functions by Hines et. al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03260).

We hope that this app can serve as a complement to these papers and provide further intuition of how the influence function can be used, specifically in the context of the ATE and the 1-step estimator.

## Running the app
